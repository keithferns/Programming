/* The Wall should contain no more than 5 elements. Rule of thumb: every screen should have 5 elements or less. This includes any input elements like navigation buttons and data displays. This principle should apply recursively to data displays as well. For example, a full screen display of an appointment should include the who/what [Dentist, Class], the time [May 15, 1:30], additional notes [Ask about cost of implant], and the three key navigation buttons.
